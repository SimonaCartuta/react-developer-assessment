### Requirements

Completed minimum requirements:

1. Retrieved the data from the mock API.
2. Displayed the data in a list, including properties from the data that are appropriate for a list view.
3. Implemented a multi-select category filter - I made the assumption that filtering by multiple categories should display posts with one or more of those categories.
4. Implemented pagination as a "load more" feature.
5. Used semantic markup where possible.
6. Created a responsive layout with HTML and CSS.

Completed bonus requirements:

1. Added animated transitions when more posts are loaded, or when the posts initially load.
